1)
series 110x: range-dependent case, bottom relief described by

hr = h0 + dh*sin( 2*pi*(r-rc)/P );

where h0=50m, P=7000,

dh = x (varies from 1m to 10m), e.g. for dh=10m depth varies between 40m and 60m along the track

Inverted parameters: R, cb, rhob

2)
series 112x: range-dependent case, bottom relief described by

hr = h0 + dh*sin( 2*pi*(r-rc)/P );

where h0=50m, P=7000,

dh = x (varies from 1m to 10m), e.g. for dh=10m depth varies between 40m and 60m along the track

Inverted parameters: R, cb, rhob, h

(main difference from (1): h is also inverted)

3)
series 113x: range-independent case

Inverted parameters cb, rhob

The algorithm is supplied with incorrect (biased) value of R to estimate the resulting inaccuracy in cb, rhob reconstruction

4)
series 114x: range-independent case

Inverted parameters cb, rhob, R

The algorithm is supplied with incorrect (biased) value of h to estimate the resulting inaccuracy in R, cb, rhob reconstruction

5) : range-dependent case, bottom relief described by

hr = h0 + dh*sin( 2*pi*(r-rc)/P );

where h0=50m, P=7000, 7000/2, 7000/4, 7000/8

dh = 8m.

Inverted parameters: R, cb, rhob

We consider influence of bottom inhomogeneities variation "speed" with range
