Test problem for normal mode computation codes

In this problem both mode functions and wavenumbers are computed.
The problem is associated with 3D ASA wedge benchmark problem.

Two-layer problem

1) bottom:

rhob = 1.5; % density
cb = 1700;  % sound speed

2) water column

rhow = 1; % density
cw = 1500; % sound speed

3) sound frequency f = 25 Hz

4) water depth: varies from 370 to 34 m

Output

1) kj_wedge_att.txt %wavenumbers kj, including imaginary part by perturbation theory
2) phizs_wedge.txt  % mode functions at z=z_s=100 m
3) phizr_wedge.txt  % mode functions at z=z_r=30 m
